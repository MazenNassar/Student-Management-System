# StudentManagement
Hello, I've developed a student management application using PyQt6 in Python. Here are its features:

Adding, deleting, viewing, searching, and updating students' information.
Determining if a student has failed or succeeded.
To add a new student, you must provide the following details: First Name, Last Name, Term, and GPA. The system will automatically assign a consecutive ID to each student. You can search for students using any of these details.

For updating student information, you'll need the ID (which you can obtain from the View or Search button) and then input the updated details.

To delete a student or check their status (failed or succeeded), only the ID is required.

The Clear button is available to clear all text boxes, and the Exit button allows you to exit the application.
